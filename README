Muduo is a multithreaded C++ network library based on the reactor pattern.
http://github.com/chenshuo/muduo

But I didn't found good openssl support.
This is a client sample use SSL_BIO and muduo.
This is a good sample for reactor networking library to use openssl.
You can easily modify it to adapt  other networking library.


#How To Use?
1.download and compile muduo library from http://github.com/chenshuo/muduo
2.modify the Makefile to adapt muduo library
3.install openssl
  for centos: yum install openssl-devel
  for ubuntu: apt install openssl libssl-dev -y
4.type make to compile this file.
5.sslclient will be in this folder




#Core tech
0. use SSL_is_init_finished() to judge the handshake is ok.

1. when you want to recv data :
BIO_write   and  SSL_read

2. when you want to send data:
SSL_write   and  BIO_read

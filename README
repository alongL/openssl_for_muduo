Muduo is a multithreaded C++ network library based on the reactor pattern.
http://github.com/chenshuo/muduo

But I didn't found there one openssl support.
This is a client sample use SSL_BIO and muduo.
This is a good sample for reactor networking library to use openssl.
You can easily modify it to adapt  other networking library.


How To Use?
1.download and compile muduo library from http://github.com/chenshuo/muduo
2.modify the Makefile to muduo library
3.install openssl
for centos: yum install openssl-devel
for ubuntu: apt install openssl libssl-dev -y
4.type make to compile this file.
5.sslclient will be in this folder
